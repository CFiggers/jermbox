# Jermbox

A Janet native module for working with nullgemm's [Termbox Next](https://github.com/nullgemm/termbox_next) for building an easier TUI.

## OS Requirements

I can only guarantee that this will work on linux systems.

I don't have the means to test this on any other environment than Linux. If you would like to see it work on your OS of choice then feel free to put in a PR or fork from this repo.

## Install Package

```sh
sudo jpm install https://github.com/MorganPeterson/jermbox
```

## Examples

Exampe usage, after installation, can be found in the examples directory.

## Ackowledgement

This borrows heavily from sepisoad's code: [jtbox](https://github.com/sepisoad/jtbox). Their code, though, works with the original [termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox) which was abandoned by the author and refactored for some unknown reason.

There are a lot more additions to my module then what sepisoad had done. Hopefully, for the better.

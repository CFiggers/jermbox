# Termbox Next Janet Bindings

A janet module for working with nullgemm's [Termbox_Next](https://github.com/nullgemm/termbox_next) TUI.

Termbox_Next is a cleaner version of the original [termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox).

## Ackowledgement

This borrows heavily from sepisoad's code: [jtbox](https://github.com/sepisoad/jtbox). Their code, though, works with the original [termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox) which was abandoned by the author and refactored for some unknown reason. There are a lot more additions to my module then what sepisoad had done. Hopefully, for the better.

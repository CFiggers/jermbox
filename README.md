# Termbox Next Janet Bindings

A janet module for working with nullgemm's [Termbox_Next](https://github.com/nullgemm/termbox_next) TUI.

Termbox_Next is a cleaner version of the original [termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox).

## OS Requirements

I can only guarantee that this will work on linux systems.

I don't have the means to test this on any other environment than Linux. If you would like to see it work on your OS of choice then feel free to put in a PR or fork from this repo.

## Ackowledgement

This borrows heavily from sepisoad's code: [jtbox](https://github.com/sepisoad/jtbox). Their code, though, works with the original [termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox) which was abandoned by the author and refactored for some unknown reason. There are a lot more additions to my module then what sepisoad had done. Hopefully, for the better.
